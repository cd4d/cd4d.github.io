##### Daily trend

![](iowa-SQL-analysis-images/SQL-timeframe-daily-trend.png)

**Yearly change / growth**

![](iowa-SQL-analysis-images/SQL-growth-products.png)

**The top products by sales amount reflect the monthly sales trend seen
above. The best-selling products by amount of sales is Black velvet, a
Canadian whisky. This product, unlike the other, fluctuated wildly over
the year, with spikes in February, May and October.**

**Another product, the American whisky Jack Daniels Old \#7, shows some
milder variations but still with a notable peak in April.**

![](iowa-SQL-analysis-images/SQL-growth-categories.png)

**Looking at categories, the shape is similar with a downward trend
towards the end of the year. However, the two most prominent categories
do not reflect the products above. Canadian Whiskies and 80 proof vodka
are the products selling the most.**

![](iowa-SQL-analysis-images/SQL-growth-percent-counties.png)

**Looking at the top counties by sales, Polk, the most populated one, is
far ahead of the rest. With a peak from March to June. The October
rebound seen in the charts preceding this one is also present.**
