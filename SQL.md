## Summary and dataset

The following is an analysis of liquor sales in the US state of Iowa. The data is publicly available on the [state's website](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy) and has 24 columns such as price, quantity, store name, tracking each individual sale of liquor.

I had access to a remote PostgreSQL database divided into 4 main tables :
