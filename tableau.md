Below is [a dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/SUperstore-Data-analysis/ProfitAnalysis?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link) created with [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) using their superstore dataset. 
This is a dataset from a brand of stores across the USA showing their sales during the period 2014-2017.

I created a story in Tableau consisting of 6 dashboards (click on the links to see details below):

[Representatives](#representatives) | [Yearly Trends](#yearly-trends) | [Profit scatterplot](#profit-scatterplot) | [Products and Region metrics](#products-and-region-metrics) | [Other metrics](#other-metrics)

### Representatives

This dashboard display the data associated with each representative. It allows for a quick comparisons using metrics such as sales, profit, losses, discount given to clients and margin.

### Yearly Trends

Details on sales, profit, discount and quantity are displayed for each year. The calendar display allows for a quick view of the chosen metric in each day of the year.

### Profit scatterplot

A scatterplot gives an overview of the profitability of categories of products. It shows clearly that copiers and furnitures are respectively the most and least profitable products. 

The map shows clusters where sales were concentrated, indicating that most of the sales are made in big cities such as new-York City, Los Angeles, Seattle.

### Product / Region metrics

Linking a map to categories/ sub categories and showing the top and bottom 20 products helps answering many questions such as where furniture made the most profit, which was the best selling product in Florida...

### Yearly Regional Metrics

This quick visualization provides a side by side comparison between the four regions over the years. The stark difference between the East and Shouth regions is easily seen.

### Other Metrics

A summary of other useful information is displayed to help answer questions regarding between profits and discounts given to customers, shipping time as well as identifying the most and least profitable customers.
